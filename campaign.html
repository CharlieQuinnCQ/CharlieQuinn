          <h1 class="card-text">Our campaign</h1>
          <h5 class="card-text">Context of campaign</h5>
        <p>Our social media campaign is about telling people what we stand for and spreading the message of our clothing brand Charlie Quinn. We stand for equality, happiness and inclusiveness and with our social media campaign we want to show that everyone can be whoever they want to be and everyone can wear whatever they want to wear. We spread this message by posting at least 3 times a week on Instagram. The posts consist of inspirational quotes to inspire people, and impactful gender facts to inform the target audience. Next to that, the facts are used to strengthen our message. We also post illustrations that show our values. These posts are promoted on Instagram stories. The story of the campaign starts with general quotes and then slowly introduces our brand and product.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We decided to use Instagram to promote our brand because of what we talked about in the part of ‘Target audience’. Instagram is a popular platform for our target audience. On top of that, in 2022, 30,1% of Instagram users are between the ages of 18 and 24 (Statista, 2022). That’s the second-largest group of all Instagram users. Besides that, we also concluded from the persona interviews that we did, that our target audience uses Instagram the most, from all the platforms that they use. Instagram is also the social media platform where people bought the most products from, we saw that in our persona interviews but that was also stated by Statista (2021).&nbsp;</p>
		   <h5 class="card-text">Learning points</h5>
<p>The first posts had the most views. So, I think what we have learned from that is to do our most important posts first and if necessary we can always do a similar post later on. Because this time around we first wanted to make people curious with some quotes and then after that we wanted to post the actual sweater and what our company does. We also didn’t want that info to get lost at the beginning, but we have now learned that we can always do a similar post when we gain new followers. We also saw that short quotes were more popular than longer quotes. We found out that pictures weren’t as popular as the quotes but we do still think that it looks nice on the feed. So, for the individual post it isn’t really necessary but for the feed on the account all together we still believe it has a positive influence. Also we thought the facts were very interesting, one did very well and the other didn’t. We think this because the fact that did not do well was already a very well-known fact that didn’t teach anyone anything new. The other fact was not as well-known and because of that way more shocking to people. Next time we are only going to share facts that are not well-known so they will shock people and provoke engagement.&nbsp;</p>
       <h5 class="card-text">Future planning</h5>
		  <p>If the project would continue we would keep posting short quotes for people to share and inspire. We want to keep inspiring people and provoking them to engage with our content. By doing this people will also keep seeing the message that our brand is trying to send and they will hopefully buy the sweater and contribute to our mission. We will also keep shocking people with unknown facts and by that get them hooked on our account. We also would post our products more often so our product doesn't get lost in all the other content. So, moving on we would post more shocking facts and less long quotes. And regarding the illustrations I think we will keep posting them each 9 text posts. &nbsp;</p>

So, this is not as uncommon as you might think. For many people, this probably comes as a suprise but we want everyone to know that this is reality and we are not okay this. “When a woman is involved in a car crash, she is 47% more likely to be seriously injured, and 71% more likely to be moderately injured, even when researchers control for factors such as height, weight, seatbelt usage, and crash intensity.” – The Guardian, 2019 “Modern seats are too firm to protect women against whiplash injuries. Cars have been designed using car crash-test dummies based on the “average” male.” – ScienceNordic, 2013. #beyou #charliequinn</p>

A study found that 7 out of 10 primary school children picture a surgeon as a male, while they picture a nurse as a female. #beyou #charliequinn&nbsp;</p>
